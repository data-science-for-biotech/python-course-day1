## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Install Python

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.
Make sure you install Python following the instructions on [the course website][python-install].

## Obtain lesson materials

1. Download [exercises.zip][zipfile]
2. Move downloaded files to `~/course/`.
3. Unzip the files.

You should see two folders called `data` and `code` in the newly created `exercises` directory in
your directory.

## Launch Python interface

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our
Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the
top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like.

## Option A: Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based interface for working with Python.

> ## Command line (Terminal)
>
> 1\. Navigate to the `data` directory:
>
> > ## Unix shell
> > If you're using a Unix shell application, such as Terminal app in macOS, Console or Terminal
> > in Linux, or WSL on Windows, execute the following command:
> > ~~~
> > cd ~/course/exercises/data
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> {: .solution}
>
> 2\. Start Jupyter server
>
> > ## Unix shell
> > ~~~
> > jupyter lab
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> {: .solution}
>
> 3\. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button on the right and selecting "Python 3"
> from the drop-down menu:
> ![Anaconda Navigator Notebook directory](
{{ page.root }}{% link fig/jupyter-notebook-launch-notebook2.png %})
{: .solution}

## Option B: Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (or VS Code) is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) that also supports writing
Python code and running Jupyter Notebooks.

> ## Command line (Terminal)
>
> 1\. Navigate to the `data` directory:
>
> > ## Unix shell
> > If you're using a Unix shell application, such as Terminal app in macOS, Console or Terminal
> > in Linux, or WSL on Windows, execute the following command:
> > ~~~
> > cd ~/course/exercises/data
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> {: .solution}
>
> 2\. Start VS Code
>
> > ## Unix shell
> > ~~~
> > code .
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> {: .solution}
